            Hey there!

I'm Anand, a Master's student of Computer Science at George Mason University and I'm currently in my third semester.

Prior to my master's program, I completed my B.E. in Computer Engineering and then worked as a QA Automation Engineer in a software company in the networking domain for two and a half years. After this, I pursued my interests and joined a full-stack web development boot camp. I am skilled in technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript, MongoDB, Node, Express, and React, using which I have made some personal projects.

Cheers!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm really interested in Web development (MERN Stack) and am looking for a summer internship and/or a technical position at GMU relating to my area of interest.

Hoping to connect with you soon.
          </p>
